# Lamarbooru

Lamarbooru is a media management system that is heavily inspired by [Hydrus](https://github.com/hydrusnetwork/hydrus).

**NOTE**: Lamarbooru is still very much a work in progress, so some things will break and might change as time goes on.
From my own testing, it has been able to handle a few hundred files and a few subscriptions at once with no issues.
Once the feature set is more complete, I'll do some more testing with larger datasets to ensure stability and reliability.
